# Image Saliency Detection
An Image Saliency detection model was built using an autoencoder and CNN's. The AutoEncoder works like a de-noising autoencoder and 
removes the background noise while preserving the relevant parts of the image. 
This was implemented as a course project for the course CS-521 Fundamentals of Data Sciences.
